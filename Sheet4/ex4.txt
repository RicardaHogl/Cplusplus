# 4.1 Recursion vs. Iteration

a) Listing 1

(i) What would happen if the depth of recursion were not constrained? Will line 11 ever be reached?
    Answ.: Line 11 will never be reached because since there is no termination condition
    for the endless stack, so the program runs in an endless loop (if there would not be an
    break up through an error).

(ii) Compile and run the program. How many times will endless() be executed? Write down
     your result!
     Answ.: endless() will be executed n = 262040 times, than the program runs in an
     segmentation fault, because ...

(iii) Add the line
      har memoryOnStack [1000];
      before the return statement in endless and execute the program. What has changed?
      Answ.:
      The program overflow the stack much faster since we need to allocate
      a new 1000-byte-Array in every call. Now endless() will be executed only
      n = 7940 times until the segmentation fault occur.

(iv) Delete the newly inserted line again and run the program a second time. Do you get the same
     result as before?
     Answ.:
     As in (ii), endless() was executes  n = 262040 times, so we have the same result as before.
     Because ...
